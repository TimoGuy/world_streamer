# World Streamer plan

## Phase 1

Final phase is to have this be a job source. Simply make this a job source from the beginning, but with a few differences from the final form.

The job source has its setup phase (which is simply empty).

After all job sources have setup, it has its first and only job: load a hardcoded level defined within a function.


## Phase 2

Create file format that loads in a level.


## Phase 3

World streaming.
